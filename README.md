A* search algorithms can be thought similar to Backtracking and Breadth-First search algorithms. It is well-known to solve problems in the domain of route finding, optimization and vice versa. 

It provides avenues of research in Artificial Intelligence to train models without backpropagation algorithms.  Oftentimes A* is considered the most challenging algorithm to write in the Graph domain and one of the fundamentals. In this repo, I have written the A* algorithm in Python to teach myself the basics of the cost function, open and closed sets and how it can be utilised.
